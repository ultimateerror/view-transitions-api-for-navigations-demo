# View Transition API (for navigations)

See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transitions_API and https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/view-transitions/ for more demos and documentations

## I cannot see any transitions. What now?

This is propapbly because it's not activated or implemented in your browser right now.

For Google chrome you can get it to work with this two flags:

```
chrome://flags#view-transition
chrome://flags#view-transition-on-navigation
```
